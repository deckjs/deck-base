# @deck/base

[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/)

This module is used by the `deck-init` command as a basis 
for generating a new slide deck. 

The code, images, and deck.md folders and file are copied
across to the target folder. A symlink from Readme.md to
deck.md is created and a package.json is created based on
user input from `deck init` prompts and the `package-template.json`
file.
